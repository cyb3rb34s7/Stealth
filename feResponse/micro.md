I'll help you research the challenge of sharing global styles between microfrontend (MFE) applications and the host/shell app when using @angular-architects/native-federation in Angular 19. Let me investigate this thoroughly.

Based on my research into sharing global styles between MFE and host applications using @angular-architects/native-federation in Angular 19, I've found that this is indeed a challenging issue with several approaches available, each with trade-offs.

## The Challenge

The core issue is that Native Federation and Module Federation are designed to keep micro frontends isolated and independent [ANGULARarchitects](https://www.angulararchitects.io/en/blog/multi-framework-and-version-micro-frontends-with-module-federation-your-4-steps-guide/) . When an MFE is loaded, global styles defined in the MFE's styles.scss don't get loaded automatically because you're typically requesting a sub-module rather than the main application [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67633345/serving-styles-and-assets-with-webpack-5-module-federation) .

## Possible Solutions

### 1. **ViewEncapsulation.None Approach (Most Elegant)**

Import your global styles.scss of the micro frontend into its entry module component.scss and set encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None in the component to break style encapsulation, which will lead to those styles being applied globally [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67633345/serving-styles-and-assets-with-webpack-5-module-federation) .

**Implementation approach:**
- Import global styles into your MFE's root component (the one you expose)
- Set ViewEncapsulation.None on that component
- The styles will then be injected when the component loads

**Pros:**
- Clean and simple
- Works with different workspaces
- No additional configuration needed

**Cons:**
- Styles affect the entire application globally
- Potential style conflicts between MFEs

### 2. **Separate CSS Bundle Approach**

Create a dedicated CSS bundle by configuring angular.json to export styles separately, then load this CSS file dynamically when the MFE is loaded [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67633345/serving-styles-and-assets-with-webpack-5-module-federation) .

**Implementation approach:**
- Configure angular.json to create a separate CSS bundle
- Load the CSS file programmatically when loading the MFE
- Use a manifest file to track CSS URLs

**Pros:**
- Complete control over when styles are loaded
- Can unload styles when MFE is removed

**Cons:**
- More complex implementation
- Requires additional loading logic

### 3. **Shadow DOM with Style Injection**

Using Shadow DOM emulation provided by Angular allows preventing styles from bleeding while still allowing global styles to be shared [ANGULARarchitects](https://www.angulararchitects.io/en/blog/multi-framework-and-version-micro-frontends-with-module-federation-your-4-steps-guide/) . When using ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom, you need to inject required CSS directly into the component's .scss file, including all third-party styles [Medium](https://medium.com/@epavliy/css-isolation-with-angular-micro-frontends-eb3bd8261bb9) .

**Implementation approach:**
- Use ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom for isolation
- Inject all needed styles into the component
- Handle overlay containers for Material components

**Pros:**
- Complete style isolation
- No global pollution

**Cons:**
- Increases bundle size due to CSS duplication for each web component instance [Medium](https://medium.com/@epavliy/css-isolation-with-angular-micro-frontends-eb3bd8261bb9)
- More complex for third-party libraries

### 4. **Shared Styles in Shell Application**

Place common styles in a shared location accessible to both host and MFEs, referenced through angular.json [Itsnotbugitsfeature](https://itsnotbugitsfeature.com/2022/03/13/sharing-common-assets-in-angulars-module-federation/) .

**Implementation approach:**
- Create a shared styles folder
- Configure angular.json in both host and MFEs to reference these styles
- Use consistent paths across projects

**Pros:**
- Centralized style management
- No duplication in runtime

**Cons:**
- Requires monorepo or shared package approach
- Less flexibility for MFE-specific styles

## Recommendations

For your Angular 19 + Native Federation setup, I recommend:

1. **For truly global styles (design system, themes):** Place them in the shell/host application and ensure MFEs are designed to inherit these styles.

2. **For MFE-specific styles that need to be global:** Use the ViewEncapsulation.None approach on your exposed component, but be careful about naming conflicts.

3. **For complete isolation:** Consider Shadow DOM if you can accept the bundle size trade-off.

4. **For production robustness:** Consider implementing a hybrid approach where critical shared styles are in the host, while MFE-specific styles use ViewEncapsulation.None with careful namespacing.

## Important Considerations

- Teams often trade some independence for global CSS rules provided by the shell [ANGULARarchitects](https://www.angulararchitects.io/en/blog/multi-framework-and-version-micro-frontends-with-module-federation-your-4-steps-guide/)
- Be careful with CSS specificity and naming conflicts
- Test thoroughly with multiple MFEs loaded simultaneously
- Consider using CSS-in-JS solutions or CSS Modules for better isolation

Would you like me to provide code examples for any of these approaches?
